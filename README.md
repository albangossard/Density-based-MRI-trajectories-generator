# Density-based-MRI-trajectories-generator
Implementation of an attraction-repulsion method that allows generating physically constrained MRI trajectories from a sampling density.

Some of these scripts were used in the following papers:
- A. Gossard, F. de Gournay and P. Weiss. Bayesian Optimization of Sampling Densities in MRI. MELBA (Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging) 2 (2023:009), 2023. [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07170.pdf)
- A. Gossard, F. de Gournay and P. Weiss. A. Gossard & P. Weiss. SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences. SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences. 2024. [PDF](https://hal.science/hal-03585120/document)

The codes were developed as part of various projects thanks to:
- Alban Gossard
- Pierre Weiss
- Frédéric de Gournay
- Léo Lebrat
